# Search Algorithms
In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values

## Linear Search
    Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm.
    It traverses the array sequentially to locate the required element.
    It searches for an element by comparing it with each element of the array one by one.
    So, it is also called as Sequential Search.

Linear Search Algorithm is applied when-

    No information is given about the array.
    The given array is unsorted or the elements are unordered.
    The list of data items is smaller.
